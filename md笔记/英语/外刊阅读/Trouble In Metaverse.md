**metaverse**: 元宇宙

> Throughout history, there has been backlash to technological progress – so why should now be any different, asks James Ball

**backlash**: 强烈反对（**a strong, negative reaction to sth, esp. to change**）







>  HARDLY a day **goes by** without some new claim promising to bring us closer to the metaverse in the not-too- distant future. Meta (the company formerly known as Facebook) and Microsoft are both enthusiastically pushing virtual reality worlds and **staking** the future of their multibillion- dollar businesses on our **receptiveness** to the idea. Vodafone is predicting that smart devices could monitor our health and even our brains by 2030. And Elon Musk has claimed his Neuralink technology may be able to help people with **paralysis** walk and enable everyone to upload their memories to the cloud within the **decade**.

**go by**   经过(to move past, in space or time)  (You can’t let an opportunity like that go by.) (Hardly a day goes by when I don’t think about her.)

**paralysis** [pəˈræləsɪs]  n. 瘫痪

**receptiveness**: 接受能力

**decade**: 十年，十年期；十进







>  On hearing about this, some of us will feel **sheer** excitement – but others will feel unsure, **uneasy** or **downright** **opposed**. Our habit in recent history has been to **shun** or **scorn** those with **misgivings** on technological progress. It may be time to re-examine that.

>  There has been a backlash to technology since historical records began. Every new form of communication – from telegram to telephone and beyond – has attracted criticism for increasing the pace of life. Novels were **condemned** for ruining attention **spans**, and people once feared that cars travelling at 20 to 30 miles per hour might **deprive** their passengers of oxygen, perhaps fatally.

**criticism** [ˈkrɪtɪsɪzəm]: 批评，批判；







> With the benefit of **hindsight**, **contemporary** **resistance** to technological advancement can look like **utter folly** – but often it isn’t. The Luddites, for example – the **smashers** of **mill** machinery in the early industrial revolution – are generally **referred to as** a historical **punchline**. But if we look at their real **grievances**, it wasn’t some naive anti-progress movement;it was about economics. **Cotton mills** replaced skilled, home- based, independent work with lower-skilled or even unskilled work, in unsafe conditions in a factory, accompanied by much less **autonomy** and much less pay.

>  The mill might have been more  efficient and thus more profitable, but it would take decades of **campaigning** to **distribute** those gains even approximately fairly – with the birth of the trade union movement, health and safety laws, the **welfare** state and more. Seen through that **prism**, was resistance really so **irrational**?

**well founded (well-founded)**   有理由的，有根据的











>  The reasons to be **wary** of the next wave of technology are **manifold**. One is simply whether the technologies **in question** are where they are claimed to be. Musk, in particular, has a habit of **overpromising**, whether on travel to Mars, **ultra**- high-speed trains or self-driving cars. Few **in the know** take his claims for **Neura**link seriously.

>  Other more **imminent** metaverse technologies rely on virtual reality, which still largely consists of **clunky** headsets and odd arm controls – all just to be able to **manoeuvre** an **avatar** through an **awkward** online world. VR has been “the next big thing” for decades and the public has **consistently** felt otherwise: there isn’t much to do once you are there, the technology gives many people **motion sickness** and, perhaps most **problematically** of all, the whole thing just seems **irredeemably** **naff**.

>  Beyond a relatively small group of **enthusiasts**, health tracking hasn’t **caught** the wider public **by storm**, **not least** because many consumers worry about what will happen to their data.
